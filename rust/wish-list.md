# My Rust wish list

Extremely incomplete.
I'm just going to dump what I can think of off the top of my head and then expand on it later, including links to existing initiatives. 

- Async drop
- `async fn` in `dyn Trait`
- crABI and `#[export]` (primarily as a mechanism for managing build times)
- Generators
- Garbage collection for Cargo
- Hooks in Cargo for external build caches
- Dynamic linking support in Cargo
- `Move` trait
- "Unforgettable" types
- Arbitrary User-definable contracts/proofs
- Dynamic scope-based lending as the ultimate safe escape hatch (TODO: this could use its own doc)
- `BTreeMap` cursors
- First-class support for Wasm Components
- `AsyncIterator`
